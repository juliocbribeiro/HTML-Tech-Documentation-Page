                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning
                    and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
                    page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or
                    between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
                    and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide
                    Web.
                </p>
                <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.

            <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
            <article>
                <p>The main parts of our element are as follows: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening
                        and
                        closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this
                        case
                        where the paragraph begins.
                    </li>
                    <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash
                        before
                        the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends.
                        Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange
                        results.
                    </li>
                    <li> The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
                    </li>
                    <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual
                    content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class
                    attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and
                    any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.</p>
                <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has
                        one or more attributes).</li>
                    <li>
                        The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                    <li>
                        The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
                </ol>
            </article>
        </section>



        <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
            <header>Nesting elements</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting.
                    if we want to emphasize any words we could wrap the word in a <code> "strong"</code>, which means
                    that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
                    <code>
                            "My cat is <"strong"> very </"strong"> grumpy.
                        </code>
                    The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one
                    another. If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at
                    what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>


        <section class="main-section" id="Empty_elements">
            <header>Empty elements</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the "img" tag element that we
                    already
                    have in our HTML page:
                    <code>
                    "img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"
                </code>
                </p>

                <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing tag and no inner content. This is
                    because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the
                    HTML page in the place it appears.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>


        <section class="main-section" id="Images">
            <header>Images</header>
            <p>
                Let's turn our attention to the "img" tag element again:
                <code>"img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src
                (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.

                We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text
                for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:
            <ol>
                <li> They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen
                    readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
                <li> Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with
                enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Marking_up_text">
            <header>Marking up text</header>
            <article>
                This section will cover some of the essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text

                <h3>Headings</h3>
                <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or
                    subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML
                    document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <code>"h1"–"h6"</code>, although you'll commonly
                    only use 3
                    to 4 at most.
                </p>
                <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
                <p>As explained above, "p" tag elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these
                    frequently
                    when marking up regular text content:
                </p>
                <h3>Lists</h3>
                <p>
                    A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always
                    consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
                <ol>
                    <li> <strong> Unordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter,
                        such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <"ul"> element.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Ordered lists </strong>are for lists where the order of the items does matter. These
                        are wrapped in an <"ol"> element.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>Links</h3>
                <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple
                    element "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a
                    link, follow these steps:
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
                    <li> Wrap the text in an "a" tag element.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at
                    the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where
                    you wanted it to.</p>
